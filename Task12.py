#  Task 12: Conclusions & Recommendations
#  Conclusions

# The dataset shows that economic factors (GDP, income composition) and social factors (schooling, health spending) are positively associated with higher life expectancy.

# Health risks such as HIV/AIDS prevalence, adult mortality, and child malnutrition (thinness) are negatively associated with life expectancy.

# Feature engineering (e.g., Total Mortality, Health-Wealth Index) slightly improved the model’s prediction performance (R² increased from ~0.63 to ~0.64).

# The final model explains ~64% of the variance in life expectancy with a 5-year average prediction error, which is reasonable for socio-economic data.

# Actionable Insights

# Governments should invest in education and income opportunities — schooling has one of the strongest positive impacts on life expectancy.

# Efforts to reduce adult mortality, child mortality, and HIV/AIDS prevalence can significantly raise average life expectancy.

# Health expenditure and GDP growth alone are not enough — equitable distribution and efficient healthcare systems matter too.

# Combining indicators can help policymakers monitor holistic health and wealth trends.
# Recommendations

# Collect more recent and complete data to further improve prediction accuracy.

# Test other regression models (e.g., Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest) to check if they outperform linear regression.

# Develop country-specific models to account for unique local factors affecting life expectancy.

# Use visual dashboards to help governments easily monitor key indicators.
